## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.

I think using Option<std::str::Lines<'a>> in LogoParser struct is not a good choice.
I thought data in Lines could be read repeatedly, like other languages. 
But then I found that after using the nth(i) method to read a certain line of commands, the line is no longer available. 
This makes the code more complex when processing the 'while' command and I had to create a Vec to store the commands. 
If I rewrite this program, I might use a container similar to Vec, so that I can easily read a certain line of commands, and it will be more convenient when handling if and while.

If you want to let us know something else about your program, put it here!
